# Class-Defined Simple Snake Game.

This is a simple snake game that I made in Python using the Pygame module.
Purpose of this project was to learn how to use Pygame and to learn how to use GitHub.
Also, I wanted to show how to make it Class-based so that it can be easily modified.

Python is usually procedural, but I wanted to show how to make it class-based.
